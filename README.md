Overview

The Heart Disease Prediction System is a machine learning-based web application designed to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients based on various health parameters. This system leverages data-driven models to assist in early diagnosis and risk assessment.

Problem Statement

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early detection and timely intervention can significantly reduce mortality rates. The goal of this project is to develop an accurate and accessible prediction system that aids in early detection using machine learning algorithms.

Objectives

To develop a machine learning model that predicts heart disease based on patient data.

To create a web application that allows users to input health parameters and receive risk assessments.

To integrate multiple classifiers and optimize model performance for better accuracy.

To align the project with Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3: Good Health and Well-being.

Features

User-friendly Web Interface: Allows users to input their health data and receive predictions.

Machine Learning Model: Trained using historical medical data to ensure accurate predictions.

Multiple Algorithm Comparison: Utilizes different machine learning techniques for better insights.

Data Visualization: Displays graphical representations of risk factors and predictions.
